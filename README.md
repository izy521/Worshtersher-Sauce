# Worshtersher-Sauce
An HTML5/Node.js game that requires you to say labyrinthine words correctly.

# Raison d'etre
This was my project for a back-end Node.js developer job. But unfortunately, due to lack of time, I was unable to complete it before its deadline. (Because I freaking hate front-end development)

However, I'm still going to finish it, and make it a fun game for people to play, similar to Cards Against Humanity.

# How to play
The rules are simple, create or join a match, then go against another player in saying words that are very difficult to say.

# Other tidbits

* So far, this project should only work on Chrome (or Firefox with some flag enabled), because it makes use of the Web Audio API.
* There's no form of lag compensation, so you can probably assume whoever's closer to the server will win every round, if you're both having no issues saying the words.
